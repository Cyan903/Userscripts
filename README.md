Collection of userscripts I've written over time. Most of these are made to run using [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), but shouldn't have issues running on other userscript managers. Currently I've written **eight** scripts for **six** websites. Scripts can be found in the `/scripts` directory.

### Install

To install a script you will need a userscript manager. I personally use Tampermonkey, but any of these should work.

-   [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome/Firefox)
-   [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) (Chrome/Firefox)
-   [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)

### Libraries Used

-   [crypto-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js) - osu.dl.user.js
-   [wshook](https://github.com/skepticfx/wshook) - skribbl-hook.user.js
-   [cors-anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) - wikigame.user.js
